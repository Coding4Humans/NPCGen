## Goal
- The goal of this project is to test and prototype functionality of chatGPT and other LLMs 
- There is no plan to fully develope the UI. It will be mostly funtion over form

## ToDo:
- Start figuring out how to save the characters to files
- Have a conversation with an NPC, try not to be cringe
- Save NPCs to specific files and recall them
- Create a UI tab for selecting or generateing NPCs
- Have two NPCs have a conversation ðŸ¤” ...

### Done
- Generate template to paste into ChatGPT, Calude, and other LLMs to test NPC generation process
- Get simple ChatGPT API calls working
- Implement UI (now using customtkinter: https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter/tree/master) 
- Use generated tempalte to make API calls
- Write save log (just for testing)


### Notes:
- Streamlitgpt is an attempt to mess around with a better looking UI but ultimately a web app is not a focus right now
- requirements.txt may have unneccesary modules in it due to testing and learning
